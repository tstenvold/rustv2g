# Rust V2G EXI Codec Library
This is a no-std Rust library designed for Embedded Systems to encode and decode V2G EXI messages.
It is ported from the C libcbv2g library generated by Cbexigen.

# In Progress
This library is currently a work in progress. The goal is to provide a complete implementation of the V2G EXI codec for Rust, with a focus on embedded systems.
